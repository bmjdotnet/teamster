# Lifecycle Tags — Steward Reference

Read this only when the operator's intent names a lifecycle key
(`work-type`, `phase`, `resolution`, `lifecycle`) or describes lifecycle work
(e.g. "backfill work-type coverage", "classify the done workunits by
work-type"). For ordinary context-key stewardship — `product-version`,
`component`, `priority`, integration keys — you do not need this file; stay in
the main skill.

## What lifecycle tags are

The WMS tag keyspace splits two ways:

- **Context tags** (`category=context`): durable metadata the operator owns —
  `product`, `component`, `priority`, `product-version`, `feature`/`bug`,
  integration keys. The steward freely defines values, refines descriptions,
  merges, retires, and backfills these. This is the main skill's home ground.
- **Lifecycle tags** (`category=lifecycle`): execution tracking the **engine and
  classifier own** — `work-type` (feature|bug|refactor|infra|research|docs|test),
  `phase` (design|build|test|review|rework), `resolution` (achieved|abandoned),
  `lifecycle` (archived). These values are seeded by migration and managed by the
  system, not by hand.

The split matters because the tools behave differently on the two categories
(below). Surface lifecycle work only when the operator asks for it.

## Lifecycle tags live on WORKUNITS, not outcomes

This trips people up, so state it plainly before you classify anything: **only
context tags inherit down the Outcome→WorkUnit DAG.** Context tags set on an
Outcome are inherited automatically by every WorkUnit beneath it — you do not
re-apply them per WorkUnit. **Lifecycle tags do not inherit; they are
per-WorkUnit.** `work-type`, `phase`, and `resolution` are applied to each
WorkUnit individually.

So when you backfill or refine `work-type`, the entities you target are
**WorkUnits**, not Outcomes. Coverage is measured over WorkUnits; you snapshot,
apply, and roll back WorkUnit tags. An Outcome legitimately carries no
`work-type` of its own — that is correct, not a gap to fill. (The one exception
is `resolution`, which marks a terminal Outcome's disposition — but you do not
backfill that; the close-out ritual sets it.)

## The hard rule: you do not reshape lifecycle vocabulary

Lifecycle values are migration-owned. You must **not** add, retire, or
recategorize them, and the tools enforce this:

- `wms_defineTag` **refuses** the system-managed lifecycle keys
  (`work-type`/`phase`/`resolution`/`lifecycle`). You cannot add a new
  `work-type` value or flip a lifecycle key's category through it. That refusal
  is expected, not a bug.
- `wms_retireTag` likewise does not demote migration-seeded lifecycle values.

What you **can** do with lifecycle tags, and the only two things you should:

1. **Refine a value's description** with
   `wms_describeTag(tagKey, tagValue, description)`. This is the one tool that
   rewrites an existing description in place, and it works for any key — including
   lifecycle. Sharpening `work-type:bug` so a cheaper model can classify against
   it is exactly its purpose.
2. **Apply / backfill values** onto entities with
   `wms_tagEntity(... source="steward")`, always wrapped in the snapshot +
   rollback contract from the main skill's Stage 5 (snapshot the batch first,
   apply with source `steward`, roll back via `wms_rollbackTags`).

If the operator wants a genuinely new work classification, that is a vocabulary
change to the migration, not a steward action — tell them so rather than
reaching for `defineTag`.

## Why `work-type` is the canonical backfill case

`work-type` ships **required** (per-KEY flag, set by migration). A workunit is
supposed to carry it before it reaches `done`, but historical data predates the
rule, so coverage is patchy. Filling that gap is the original reason this skill
exists — and it is pure lifecycle backfill, which is why it lives here and not in
the main flow.

The same six-stage flow from the main skill applies; the only differences are
that you refine (never redefine) the lifecycle vocabulary, and `work-type` is
your usual target. Walk it as: audit the `work-type` descriptions → inspect
coverage and tagged-set patterns → bake rules into the descriptions → propose a
batch → execute with snapshot/rollback → persist.

### Refined-description worked example

The durable artifact is a description sharp enough to classify against. For
`work-type:bug`, refine via `wms_describeTag("work-type", "bug", ...)` to:

> "Fixes incorrect existing behavior. Indicators: title contains 'fix', entity
> has a `bug:*` context tag, parent outcome is about debugging or repair,
> interval phases show build→test→rework (the correction pattern). NOT infra
> even when it fixes a build script — infra fixes tooling, bug fixes product
> behavior."

A description like that lets a cheap model (or a human) classify reliably; a
vague one ("a bug fix") does not. Sharpen the description **before** classifying
anything against it.

### Cross-reference other WMS signal

When classifying an untagged workunit's `work-type`, the title alone is rarely
enough. Pull in the rest of the WMS context:

- **Sibling context tags** — a `bug:*` tag points at `work-type:bug`; a
  `feature:*` tag points at `feature`.
- **Parent outcome** — its title and tags frame what the work was for (an
  outcome about "docs cleanup" makes `docs` likely).
- **Interval phase history** — a build→test→rework arc reads as a correction
  (bug); a clean build→test→done arc reads as new work (feature).
- **Git branch / session context** — branch names and the session's other work
  often disambiguate.

Show the operator a sample of untagged entities and ask them to classify a few
by hand first — their answers teach you what they mean by each value and expose
any description that's still too vague to fix.

## Volume → execution model (same as the main skill)

The model-tier decision is identical to the main skill's Stage 4:

- **≤20 entities — classify inline.** Walk them yourself, call
  `wms_tagEntity(... source="steward")` in a loop, present each batch for review.
- **20+ entities — don't classify inline.** Either hand a cheaper agent
  (sonnet, or haiku for obvious cases) the refined descriptions as the rubric
  plus the entity list and have it emit a JSONL plan you review and apply, or
  write a one-off script (Go/SQL) when the rule is mechanical (conditional on
  other tags, date ranges, joins). Either way the output is a reviewable plan,
  never a blind bulk-apply.

## Execute with rollback — unchanged

Lifecycle backfill uses the exact snapshot/rollback contract from the main
skill's Stage 5: choose a batch id `steward-<key>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>`, call
`wms_snapshotEntityTags` before applying, apply with source `steward`, and roll
back with `wms_rollbackTags(batchID)` — which reverts only entries whose source
is still `steward` and skips anything a human re-tagged as `manual`. Refining a
description is **not** rolled back; that is a deliberate vocabulary improvement.
